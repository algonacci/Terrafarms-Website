# The official website of Terrafarms.

Terrafarms is an IoT and AI-based agricultural technology product that offers comprehensive solutions to farmers, from the beginning of the process until the end. Our mission is to provide farmers with innovative tools and solutions that can help improve the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability of agriculture. We leverage IoT and cutting-edge machine learning to develop models that can accurately classify different types of soil and recommend the best crops for a particular soil type.

In addition to our soil analysis and crop recommendation services, we also help farmers access markets to sell their products. We leverage our extensive network and marketplace platform to connect farmers with buyers, ensuring that they get fair prices for their produce. Moreover, we sell the products that farmers need to grow their crops, including seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. By providing a one-stop-shop for all their agricultural needs, we aim to simplify the farming process and help farmers maximize their yields.

Furthermore, we have developed models that can detect and diagnose plant diseases based on visual symptoms. This allows farmers to take timely and informed actions to prevent crop losses and ensure better yields. Our ultimate goal is to create a more data-driven, efficient, and sustainable approach to agriculture that can benefit not only farmers but also the environment and society as a whole.
