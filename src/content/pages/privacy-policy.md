*Updated on July 16, 2021*

The following Privacy Policy explains how Terrafarms ("the Company" or "we") obtains, collects, stores, uses, processes, controls, transfers, discloses, transmits, destroys, and protects Users' Personal Information. This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Terrafarms application, hereinafter referred to as the "Application," website ([www.terrafarms.com](http://www.terrafarms.com)), services, or application products, unless otherwise stated in a separate privacy policy.

Your privacy is important to us, so please take the time to understand how our privacy provisions work. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact us at [contact@terrafarms.com](mailto:contact@terrafarms.com). We are continuously developing, and our Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will not make any significant changes to the Privacy Policy without prior notification of such changes through our Application.

**Information Collection**

We collect various types of information as follows:

1. Registration Information: When you create a Terrafarms Account, we ask you to provide personal information such as your name, phone number, and date of birth. We also ask you to personalize your user experience with other information such as your location. This information, collectively referred to as "Registration Information," is required.

2. User ID and Device ID: When you install the Terrafarms Application, we create unique identification numbers associated with the software installation ("User ID" and "Device ID").
